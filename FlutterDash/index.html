		<p><small><em>Last updated: September 20, 2016</em></small></p>
		<p>Hello everypony, and welcome to FlutterDash Factor!</p>
		<p>The main goal of FlutterDash Factor (or FDF for short) is to provide an episode-by-episode breakdown of interactions between Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy, from the TV show, <em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</em>. Along with facts and events from the show, it will also provide possible interpretations of these facts, which will be clearly separated from everything else. Obviously the interpretations will have a bias towards putting Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy together, but these interpretations will never be intermingled with the facts. You can decide for yourself.</p>
	</header>
	
	<section id="intro">
		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>By far one of the most common character pairings on MLP:FiM is Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy. Generally the six main characters of the show are all thought to be "best buddies" with each other, and the episodes tend to revolve around that sort of dynamic. However, over time it has become pretty clear that the creators and writers of the show tend to put more weight and emphasis on certain pairings than others.</p>
		<p>At the very least, FDF will only provide interpretations that suggest a closer bond between RD and Fluttershy than the others. Whether this should be interpreted as platonic or romantic is an entirely different topic and is best left to the reader.</p>

			<h2>S1E16: Sonic Rainboom</h2>
			<section class="point">
				<img src="img/s01e16-01.jpg" title="Yaay!">
				<section class="facts">
					<p>In the episode's opening, Rainbow Dash is seen teaching Fluttershy the elements of a good cheer. When Fluttershy is unable to cheer loudly enough, Rainbow encourages her to yell <em>louder</em>.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>The fact that Rainbow Dash would bother teaching Fluttershy to cheer in the first place shows that she wants to make her a more assertive pony. RD encourages Fluttershy to be better than she is.</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section class="point">
				<img src="img/s01e16-02.jpg" title="You've got to learn to be more assertive, Fluttershy! Don't be afraid to speak up.">
				<section class="facts">
					<p>As Rainbow and Fluttershy are flying towards Cloudsdale, Rainbow implores her, directly, to be more assertive.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Once again, Rainbow is trying to make Fluttershy a better pony. And if it were just for the sake of cheering her on, she probably wouldn't bother so much compared to any of the other five.</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section class="point">
				<img src="img/s01e16-03.jpg" title="A SONIC RAINBOOM! SHE DID IT! SHE DID IT! WOOOO!">
				<section class="facts">
					<p>When Rainbow is finally able to pull off a Sonic Rainboom, Fluttershy starts hopping up and down joyously while cheering more loudly than she's done before.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>In any other context this kind of cheering would seem out of character for Fluttershy, but it's very much understandable given the extenuating circumstances in the episode. But besides that, Fluttershy is the only one flipping out, while the other three are simply gawking in astonishment.</p>

			<h2>S1E23: Cutie Mark Chronicles</h2>
			<section class="point">
				<img src="img/s01e23-01.jpg" title="Leave her alone!">
				<section class="facts">
					<p>When the CMC go around town and find out the cutie mark stories of the Mane 6, they come across Fluttershy. She mentions that Rainbow Dash stood up to bullies who were making fun of her at Summer Flight Camp. It is also implied that Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash knew each other and were perhaps friends since they were fillies.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>While it's not unreasonable to think that Rainbow Dash could have stood up for any of her friends, there's also the fact that the three bullies in Flight Camp were likely there from the start. They've probably bullied others before. We have no idea at this point if Rainbow Dash ever stood up to them off-screen (until later in season 5), but for the moment it's clear that Rainbow cares about Fluttershy enough to go through the effort of winning a race just to defend her honor. It would have been enough for her just to tell them off, but Rainbow went the extra mile.</p>

			<h2>S2E07: May the Best Pet Win!</h2>
			<section class="point">
				<img src="img/s02e07-01.jpg" title="Really?! You really want a pet? Really?! Because I've got so many wonderful choices at my house!">
				<section class="facts">
					<p>When Rainbow Dash mentions that she's considering adopting a pet, Fluttershy excitedly tells her that she has a lot of choices at her home.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Fluttershy doesn't typically get <em>this</em> excited about anything, which we've seen in Sonic Rainboom. It's only when Rainbow does something that she doesn't expect, like perform a Sonic Rainboom, or show interest in wanting a pet, that she breaks out of her normally calm demeanor. She also never gets this excited for what any of the other five do.</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section class="point">
				<img src="img/s02e07-02.jpg" title="I have so many wonderful choices, just wait you will see! (boop)">
				<section class="facts">
					<p>Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash break into a duet that has them figuring out the perfect pet for RD.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Nose boops happen every so often with others, but it's still a subtle sign of a close bond between two ponies. But ignoring that, at the beginning of the song we have Fluttershy singing "Rainbow <em>my dear</em>, I cannot express my deliiight". This is the only time in the show that this happens, but Fluttershy specifically calls her "my dear". Another sign of closeness. You could argue that Fluttershy would call anypony such a thing, but as of yet it hasn't happened to anypony except Rainbow.</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section class="point">
				<img src="img/s02e07-03.jpg" title="I have plenty of wonderful creatures who soar in the skyyyy!">
				<section class="facts">
					<p>Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash continue on with their duet, with Rainbow increasingly wanting a pet who can fly and keep up with her speed.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Besides the obvious hoof around Rainbow's shoulders, there is also Fluttershy's insistence at finding Rainbow a pet. Rainbow even shows signs of giving up and walking away, but Fluttershy <em>insists</em> and keeps looking for more options.</p>

			<h2>S2E10: Secret of my Excess</h2>
			<section class="point">
				<img src="img/s02e10-01.jpg" title="Pinkie: Somepony do something! / RD: On it!">
				<section class="facts">
					<p>As Rarity and Spike start plummeting towards the ground, Rainbow jumps into action and specifically drags along Fluttershy to help.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>It is clear from Fluttershy's expression that she's very reluctant to do this, but Rainbow drags her along anyway. She could have called upon any other pegasus in Ponyville to help out, one that wasn't so shy and reserved, but she didn't. This is but one example of Rainbow pushing Fluttershy to be more than she is.</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section class="point">
				<img src="img/s02e10-02.jpg" title="Rainbow: (glare intensifies)">
				<section class="facts">
					<p>As Rainbow and Fluttershy are rushing towards Rarity and Spike, Fluttershy is barely registering what's going on, but soon accepts it.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>As soon as Fluttershy realises what's going on, she gives a sheepish expression to Rainbow, to which she responds with a glare. Rainbow doesn't like to stand for Fluttershy's meekness in times when there are bigger issues at hand. But even knowing how meek Fluttershy is, Rainbow still went along with this plan because she believed that Fluttershy was capable of helping out.</p>

			<h2>S2E15: The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000</h2>
			<section class="point">
				<img src="img/s02e15-01.jpg" title="C'mon, Fluttershy! Cider season's about to start!">
				<section class="facts">
					<p>At the beginning of the episode, Rainbow Dash crashes into Fluttershy's cottage and starts frantically alterting her to the start of cider season.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Fluttershy has no emotional investment in cider season like Rainbow Dash does. She's not even aware of any problems. But Rainbow sepcifically flies into her cottage just to get her out of bed, for seemingly no reason. She could have pulled away any other pony in the town, but she picked Fluttershy, likely because she's the closest to her and knew that Fluttershy would listen and not object.</p>
					<p>Additionally, we see another example of Rainbow not caring much for Fluttershy's meekness after she pulls the blanket off.</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section class="point">
				<img src="img/s02e15-02.jpg" title="She always ends up ahead of us in line, and they always run out of cider!">
				<section class="facts">
					<p>Rainbow Dash forces Fluttershy out of her home and starts telling her how Pinkie Pie takes over every cider season.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Fluttershy, even if she listens to Rainbow's problems, doesn't actually care for her problem in the same way. She's almost apathetic about it, but of course goes along with it because they're close friends.</p>
					<p>And of course there's the position of Rainbow's hoof, there. Careful where you place that, RD!</p>

				<img src="img/s02e21-01.jpg" title="There's nothing fun about dragons! Scary, yes. Fun, no!">
				<section class="facts">
					<p>Rainbow Dash is seen attempting to drag Fluttershy out of her cottage in order to see the dragon migration.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Fluttershy's dragon phobia is prominently shown in the Dragonshy episode, and everypony is aware of it. Despite that, Rainbow tries to force her out of her cottage because she believes that she can get over her fear.</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section class="point">
				<img src="img/s02e21-02.jpg" title="Twilight: Do you really want to pass up a chance like that? / Fluttershy: Now that you put it that way... yes!">
				<section class="facts">
					<p>Despite Rainbow Dash's and Twilight's efforts, Fluttershy continues to subbornly refuse to attend the dragon migration out of her fear of dragons.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Even with Fluttershy continuously refusing to attend, Rainbow Dash refuses to give up. Any other of the Mane 6 wouldn't try to push Fluttershy so much to do something that she obviously doesn't want to do, and Rainbow is only doing it because she thinks Fluttershy can be better than that.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="facts">
					<p>Rainbow Dash mentions to Fluttershy that she had previously dragged Rainbow along to see a butterfly migration, believing that Fluttershy should now see the dragon migration in return.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>The fact that Rainbow agreed to attend the butterfly migration with Fluttershy suggests that their bond is close enough that they would humor each other's interests, however different they might be, just to keep the other pony happy.</p>

				<section class="facts">
					<p>Fluttershy actively rebels against Rainbow Dash's request, knocking her down and leaping out of the cottage in the opposite direction. Rainbow Dash lets her go.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Even Rainbow Dash knows when to give up. As much as she wanted Fluttershy to go, there's only so much she could do with such resistance. Even still, Rainbow doesn't get mad at her.</p>

				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Rainbow Dash knows Fluttershy well enough to notice that she's disguised as a tree. Not wanting her to be so scared of tornado duty, she pushes her to go since nopony else will.</p>

					<p>Not fooled by Fluttershy's fake illness, Rainbow Dash dumps cold water on her to "cure" her.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Even though Fluttershy is technically trying to lie, Rainbow doesn't take offense to it and instead reveals the farce because she wants Fluttershy to do what she needs to do. She understands that Fluttershy is just scared rather than a liar.</p>

				<section class="facts">
					<p>After revealing Fluttershy's "illness", Rainbow asks her what's really going on.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>There is a notable tone shift in Rainbow's voice when she asks Fluttershy's what's going on. It turns into the tone of a concerned friend, and it's a softer tone that Rainbow knows she needs to adopt when talking to Fluttershy specifically.</p>

					<p>After Fluttershy tells her story of her peers making fun of her at Flight Camp, Rainbow Dash initially takes a harsh tone afterwards, but then corrects herself.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Rainbow knows that Fluttershy is a softie and changes her tone mid-conversation to match it. It's a profound moment that signifies just how much Rainbow knows and cares about Fluttershy and how sensitive she is.</p>

				</section>

				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Both Twilight and Rainbow don't want to tell her the truth about her wing speed, but Rainbow is the one who speaks up. She knows that Fluttershy would take it the wrong way if the wing speed were too low, and specifically said "point five" to make it seem larger than it was, in order to spare her feelings.</p>

				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Rainbow's attempts to comfort Fluttershy are in vain at this point. But it's clear how much she cares about her. In this snapshot Rainbow is very clearly concerned and wants to chase after her, but knows that she needs time to herself. Still, she's disappointed and saddened that Fluttershy is so distressed.</p>

					<p>Rainbow would never accept anything but the best from herself, but despite that she tries to reassure Fluttershy that it doesn't matter so much that her wingpower doesn't match everypony else's. She still wants her to shine, even if just a little.</p>

					<p>Spike mentions (tactlessly) that they would still have plenty of wingpower to lift water to Cloudsdale even without Fluttershy.

					<p>These sorts of "pet names" are typically reserved for closer friends. None of the other Mane 6 call her Dashie, except for Pinkie Pie (who is bubbly and affectionate towards everypony).

					<p>Often times Fluttershy can be kind of a fault. She likes Rainbow enough that she would be willing to be away from Ponyville for "who knows how long" just so Rainbow can get what she wants. This is a kind of sacrifice that few ponies would be willing to make, even for a friend.</p>

				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Fluttershy shows some tough love towards Rainbow Dash. She knows Rainbow to the point where she knows she can take such an approach without her getting offended by it. None of the other four think of this approach, and it's something Fluttershy would typically avoid with any other pony.</p>

					<p>While the interpretation should be obvious, I'll go ahead regardless. This would be the first time in the series where we see Fluttershy and Rainbow this close to each other. Granted, while comforting a distraught friend in this manner isn't indicative of something unique between these two, it's something that the other four could have done already by this point. But Fluttershy is the one who knows that Rainbow wouldn't object to this. Rarity later goes in only because Fluttershy starts crying, and Pinkie because Twilight is an emotionless robot.</p>
					<p>Also, I'm pretty sure I have diabetes at this point.</p>

					<p>Right after Rainbow Dash lowers to the ground, defeated by the citizens' stubborness, Fluttershy consoles her by petting her mane, to which Rainbow Dash does not object. Rainbow Dash is not known to be a particularly affectionate pony, though this has changed over the seasons.

			<section class="point">
				<img src="img/s06e07-01.jpg" title="Rainbow Craaash! Rainbow Craaash!">
				<section class="facts">
					<p>A flashback scene taking place at Flight Camp shows the origin of the nickname "Rainbow Crash." Rainbow Dash misperforms a stunt and ends up crashing into a garbage can, prompting most of her audience to laugh at her. Fluttershy is seen in the background not joining in on the laughter.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>The fact that Fluttershy does not join in on making fun of Rainbow is perhaps an indication that they were already friends. It can also simply be an expression of Fluttershy's character; she's not one to make fun of others, especially since others have made fun of her as well. Either way, this would be a good sign for friendship between the two, and would serve as common ground.</p>

				<section class="facts">
					<p>Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash are invited over for lunch at the home of Fluttershy's parents.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Up until now, we've not heard anything about Fluttershy's family, but the fact that they invited Rainbow Dash suggests that she has perhaps been there before. This is further suggested by Rainbow Dash when she mentions that she likes to be some place quiet after being busy with the Wonderbolts. Then, a little later in the scene, Rainbow relays a memory of Zephyr Breeze that had taken place before the events of the episode.</p>

				<section class="facts">
					<p>Rainbow Dash appears uninterested as Zephyr Breeze sits next to him and relays his experiences in mane therapy training.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Throughout the episode, Zephyr keeps suggesting that Rainbow has some kind of crush on him, but she does not reciporicate or entertain this thought, and instead immediately vents to Fluttershy as she walks in. This shows that Rainbow is more willing to be open with her than with Zephyr.</p>

				<section class="facts">
					<p>Rainbow Dash points out plainly to Fluttershy that she has been quieter than usual.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Rainbow Dash knows Fluttershy well enough that she knows how quiet she should be, and expresses concern when things seem off. This also gives off the suggestion that they do indeed keep each other company pretty regularly, which is further shown by the fact that they're still together here even after leaving her house.</p>

				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Rainbow Dash gets some mild entertainment from hearing Fluttershy swear (at least, what is considered a swear in Equestria). Applejack asks if Zephyr is having another one of his "extended stays", which means that this has happened before, and that Rainbow Dash is all too familiar with it. This provides further implication that Rainbow has spent a lot of time around Fluttershy and her family.</p>

				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Yet again, Rainbow Dash is seen hanging around Fluttershy while also showing concern for her family issues. Typically, according to Rainbow Dash's character, this sort of stuff would bore her and drive her away, but she is clearly invested in Fluttershy and her family, and is willing to go through these hurdles with her (at least until Zephyr tries to flirt again).</p>

					<p>After Zephyr fails to complete two different jobs, Rainbow Dash lays out her plan for a job at Wonderbolts Headquarters. She gives a frustrated sigh as Zephyr interprets this as a way for Rainbow to spend more time with him.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Both Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy express disapproval as Zephyr makes his off-handed remarks towards Rainbow. By this point it can be perhaps reasonably assumed that Rainbow and Fluttershy are closer to each other than either of them with Zephyr.</p>

				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Yet again, Rainbow Dash sticks around to give Fluttershy some encouragement in her decisions. Throughout the show, Rainbow has never shown this level of concern for family issues with anypony else. Moreover, it's pretty clear that she wants to see Fluttershy happy whenever she can help it.</p>

				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>While it's a bit obvious that Fluttershy would step in to get her brother back on his hooves, it's a little less obvious that Rainbow Dash would continue to be by her side and help her with such a personal issue. Rainbow Dash is committed to see this to the end.</p>

				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>Fluttershy and Rainbow work together to give Zephyr a bit of encouragment in trying to actually finish something as an important first step in conquering his fear of failure. It's pretty clear that Rainbow and Fluttershy have worked well together in getting through this ordeal.</p>

				<section class="facts">
					<p>Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash reinforce the lesson of perseverance through the song.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>In this particular scene, there is a bit of subtle imagery/symbolism going on. The spotlight is on Fluttershy as she mentions and expresses that everypony has a time when they doubt themselves. This could perhaps be a subtle callback to Hurricane Fluttershy, an episode where Fluttershy had to go through her own struggles in self-doubt.</p>
					<p>Meanwhile, Rainbow Dash appears and gives a wink as she mentions that you can work out your problems if you give it your all. This, too, resembles what happened in Hurricane Fluttershy, which is also where Rainbow Dash was heavily involved in Fluttershy's struggle. Fluttershy is seen in the spotlight giving what is perhaps a knowing smile.</p>

			<section class="point">
				<img src="img/s06e11-11.jpg" title="Have you heard from Zephyr? Is he doing well?">
				<section class="facts">
					<p>Fluttershy's parents suggest that they believe that Rainbow Dash must feel good after pining for Zephyr all this time. Rainbow Dash appears taken aback, and is about to say something before Fluttershy interjects.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="interpretation">
					<p>This would seem like an important point for Rainbow Dash to clear up with Fluttershy's parents, but decides not to as Fluttershy interrupts. This can be taken a number of ways, the most innocent being that Rainbow Dash doesn't want to interrupt the new line of conversation made by Fluttershy.</p>
					<p>Another interpretation is that Rainbow Dash sees this as a bit of a complex and/or conflicting issue for one reason or another. I'll leave that for the reader to decide.</p>

		<h1>Omissions</h1>
		<p>Some episodes of the show containing Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy together have been purposefully omitted for various reasons, which are explained below for each episode.</p>

		<h2>S2E11: Hearth's Warming Eve</h2>
		<p>The Mane 6 are chosen to put on a play depicting the founding of Equestria. Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy play the parts of Commander Hurricane and Private Pansy, respectively. This isn't quite considered FlutterDash interaction because, for one, they were playing characters. Second, out of the Mane 6 they are the only two pegasi. There were no other characters who could have played their parts.</p>

		<h2>S2E26: A Canterlot Wedding, Part 2</h2>
		<p>The fight sequence in this episode contains a scene where Rainbow Dash fights off some changelings and helps Fluttershy up from the ground. Because of the way in which their faces get close to each other, as well as the faint sound effect that plays when this happens, some people have interpreted this as a cleverly hidden kiss.</p>
		<p>It's more likely that there's nothing special going in in this scene. A ton of freeze frames in the show can be taken out of context and be made to look like something they're not.</p>
